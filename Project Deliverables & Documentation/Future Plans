Plans for The Future: 

If we had more time to implement the application, we would do a variety of things to add functionality described below: 

  1. Store user's search history/favorite alcoholic beverage
      - We initially planned for this to be implemented in the app early on, but were constrained on time and decided it was not staple to         be incorporated into the final version. 
      
  2. Add Twitter 3rd Party Authentication, in conjunction with Facebook
      - Got Facebook done, but ran into some troubles with Twitter. 
     
  3. Add a function/button for user to log out of the application. 
  
  4. Make Bar Crawl section to cater beyond just the BU Campus.
